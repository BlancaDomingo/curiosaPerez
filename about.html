        <h1>Curiosa PÃ©rez</h1>
        <p> I feel, Jewelry is more than just a pretty piece that is purchased for the monetary value of a stone or its
            precious metals. I have found that this perspective is just one small element to a bigger picture.</p>
        <p>       
         <img class="imgR" src="./img/postal4.jpg" alt="old colored photo with a gipsy woman wearing a lot of jewelry"> 
        I have travelled all over the world and even researched in small villages that held onto ancient traditions.
        Through my years in this field, I have discovered so much more depth to my knowledge of jewelry and adornment. I
        found that history, art, tradition and culture can not help but to be a big influence on adornment. Culture
        becomes embedded into this medium through every stitched or stamped symbol in fabric and every carved and
        engraved mark in metal jewelry. </p>
        <p>
            My journey to developing my voice in adornment has taken many twists and turns. After art school, I began
            exploring and collecting hand made traditional clothing, costumes, objects and jewelry. I found history and
            culture so fascinating that it has influenced my style and now I embed my own history into my personal
            jewelry work.</p>
        <p>
            I found, Nomadic people wore their wealth because they were on the move and there was not a sedentary place
            to keep it safe. Jewelry pieces and adornment were worn in layers of expressive moveable rich culture
            documenting a lifestyle and story of each individual culture. </p>
        <p><img class="imgL" src="./img/amulet.jpg" alt="diferent talisman of buddhismus ">
            At the root of all ancient adornment I found a story line of symbolism created by its people with what
            colors were around them, what food they hoped to catch, what evil spirits they hoped to repel, recorded
            wars, love, marriages,births and more. </p>
        <p>
            And while pieces were being created by artists and craftsmen of its time, one can see their hopes, fears,
            desires, and material that people felt had an importance. Folk tales, music and dance were a big part of
            building shapes of adornment and jewelry.</p>
        <p><img class="imgR" src="./img/eye.jpg" alt="a lot of traditional devil eye pendants hanging on a there">
            I witnessed beautiful cultural dances as a big picture that included magnificent visual adornment of
            costumes and layers of jewelry moveable and chiming with each drum beat, Adornment in its splendor that
            tells a holistic and complete story of individual culture. </p>
        <p>
            As for jewelry, I began to see a common thread throughout all cultures. .I collected Magical pieces that
            were created of metal, stone, gems, small objects, marks, icons and symbolism to protect and ward off evil
            and to bring abundance, love, prosperity and other qualities that one would wish for, as well as warding off
            the negative evil eye. </p>
        <p>
            These magical jewelry pieces were and are called Talismans, Amulets and Prayer boxes. They are personal
            pieces of adornment built with a high and specific vibration. </p>
        <p><img class="imgL" src="./img/ganesha.jpg" alt="Ganesha party in Indien with a lot of people">
            Talismans are objects charged with positive or negative energy by a person through energies of the moon, the
            sun, day of the week, Talismans, at its core, spread their magic by a repetition of seeing a word (or an
            object that makes you feel a particular way such as happy, enlightened or in love or full with strength and
            abundance. Talismans are built to bring us joy, happiness, with the repetition of viewing and by charging
            qualities. </p>
        <p>
            This knowledge and research is at the core of all of my current work and vibrant line of jewelry. I build
            vibrationally charged Talismans and my current line is brimming with this energy. I encourage light, love
            and joy into our world through the idea of Talismans, gems and unusual objects. (link to writings on my
            current jewelry line and photos) </p>
        <p>
            Even now, Adornment speaks of who we are or who we want to become, our social status and how we feel about
            ourselves through subtle symbolism of shape, color, movement and material. </p>
        <p>
            Personal adornment tells your own story. Universally, known as Talismans.</p>
